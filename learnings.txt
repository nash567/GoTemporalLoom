- Context cancel doesnt sends any value to done channel, it only closes the channel, on subsequest calls to cancel function it doesnt panic as closing a already closed channel panics in go but its handled by context package.
- golang type  assertion works with interface, if you have a interface defined in pkgA which has some method that returns primitive type and there a packageB with some interface and same methods if you want to use packageB interface in place of interfaceA you can do that without type assertion,
   but if interface has some methods that return another interface then typer assertion is needed.
